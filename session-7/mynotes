CLIENT AND SERVER SYSTEM

- The client is the one who starts the communication. He does a request to the server, then the server responds.
 The server can attend the number of cients he had specified before, he can attend many requests. If there is no client,
 there is no problem because the client will be there waiting until there is onw. But on the other hand, the client
 needs an executed server for being functional.

-Client and server programs can be on the same computer or on different ones. We can find this kind of programs on
mobile phones, tablets, laptops, etc.

- Internet is in charge of connecting the programs by many computers interconnected in networks. The IP adress is
related with the network interface so thisi is the reasson why computers may have more than one IP adress depending on
it's connection.

Activity 1: Find the IP address of your mobile phone.
    IP mobile adress: 192.168.1.83

Activity 2: IP adress of your coputer.
    IP adress: 192.168.1.79

 -Explain the Ping command: This command let us to see how the connection is working, also it measures the time it
 takes for the Ping command to reach the machine and return.

 Activity 3:
 C:\Users\Pablo>ping 8.8.8.8

Haciendo ping a 8.8.8.8 con 32 bytes de datos:
Respuesta desde 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 tiempo=11ms TTL=119
Respuesta desde 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 tiempo=9ms TTL=119
Respuesta desde 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 tiempo=9ms TTL=119
Respuesta desde 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 tiempo=7ms TTL=119

Tiempos aproximados de ida y vuelta en milisegundos:
    Mínimo = 7ms, Máximo = 11ms, Media = 9ms


URL: identifying a computer interface for humans. The URL has an IP address.
Activity 7:
    ping to www.google.com: 216.58.211.228 (IP direction)
Activity 8:
    ping to www.urjc.es: 212.128.240.50

Port: inside a mobilem tablet, computer, etc; we have many different applications, the port refers to the applications
that are available to connect. For indentifying app we use the pair (IP, port)

Socket: the place were the client connects for communicating with the server.
